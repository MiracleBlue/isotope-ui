# Isotope UI theme

A clean and low contrast UI theme that lets you focus on code.

Isotope relies on syntax-variables.less to set a background color, and derives all other colors from that. It's intended to provide an easy-on-the-eyes backdrop for your code, with well balanced typography, whitespace and contrast. The colors adjust to the syntax theme, but tends towards dark-ish. As soon as Isotope reaches a proper level of polish and elegance I plan to add controls for you to customize such variables as dark-ness and fonts.

Thanks to [@simurai](https://github.com/simurai) for the work on the [one-dark-ui](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui) theme that Isotope was forked from.

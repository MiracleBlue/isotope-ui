# Isotope UI theme

A clean and low contrast UI theme that lets you focus on code.

Based on the groundwork laid in one-dark-ui. It relies on syntax-variables.less to set a background color, and derives all other colors from that.


## Future plans

- Support tweaking saturation and contrast via settings-view
- A config option for font-size (everything is already rem-based and ready for this)
- Offer more font choices (currently packages Open Sans)
- Test for and improve support for Windows/Linux (e.g. scrollbars etc.)
- Refactor and clean up
- Tweak and improve stuff for packages
- Use it every day
